#Baking Inclusivity and Accessibility Into Software
SARA INÉS CALDERÓN, @SaraChicaD | HOLLY GIBSON, @hollyglot

Most technology is exclusive. It is designed for a specific subset of the population, intentionally or not. Non-typical users are deterred and have a subpar user experience—especially people with hearing/visual impairments, LGBT folks, women, even users with unusual characters in their names. Yet, creating accessible technology is not expensive, complicated, or by any means impossible—so why not do it? A hidden market is waiting for you!

We will demonstrate formulas for baking accessibility into existing technology without much cost, and guide you through building a simple web application with accessible features. We will also share strategies for developing inclusive tech down the road.
