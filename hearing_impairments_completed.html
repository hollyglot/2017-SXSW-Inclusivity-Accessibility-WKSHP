You have to start from scratch. You've got to take that call and say, 'Sorry, I can't talk right now.' Hang up on the past. That's what we've done at Vooza. Vooza brings together group messaging, recommendations, and local search in a way that's real time and customizable and then also we steal data from your phone and sell it. When it comes to design, everything we do is simple, elegant, functional. I look at a teapot and I say, 'How can our interface be more like steam? Invisible yet forceful.' Our process? Agile. And we... we make sure our app is filled with authenticity and passion... and we're constantly coming up with questions... like what if, what if like buttons? Can they be local? What if you could leave user reviews on members of your family? What if your photo filters had an API and what if that API had its own photo filter? We believe in the power of iteration. We originally started off as Stumble Monkey, which was like Airbnb but for online dating so when you left town you could rent out your spouse and partner. Great idea, but we found out, it was illegal so then we had to pivot. We changed our name to Guhguhgupta and that's with six r's. And that app was like Spotify meets Grindr but for rental cars but run as if it was for a hotel. And then from there we pivoted again and formed FlipSpot. And that was like Instapaper meets Kickstarter and a little bit like Quora but without the questions. And we took your credit card payments and made them animated gifs. Every startup can tell you how much you learn from failure. And if you look at how much we've failed that's where you can see how smart we've become. We believe in radical, impactful, transparency. Something that we call Radimparency. And that's why we're going to bring cameras into our office and show you the process in our team as we build our app. You're going to get to see the best social, local, mobile and real-time web app that's ever been built from the ground up. Watch out world because the Vooza volcano is about to disrupt. Vooza.
