 	<h1>You need UTF-8 charset in your life, specifically in your HTML</h1>

 	<p>To tell your software to accept special characters you're going to want to use the UTF-8 charset in the <head> section of your HTML document (first thing because it tells the browser how to interpret your page) like this:
 	</p>

 	<img src="./meta.png"/>

 	<h1>You may also have to update your server encoding</h1>
 	<p>Make sure that your HTTP header is also UTF-8.</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li>If you're using PHP you can use the header() function:</li>
 		<li style="font-style: italic;">header('Content-Type:text/html; charset=UTF-8');</li>
 		<li>There are other ways to make sure your HTTP header is using UTF-8, just depends on your tech.</li>
 		<li>You can find more about this <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/docs/enduser-utf8.html#fixcharset-server">here</a>.</li>
 	</ul>


 	<h1>Also in your database</h1>

 	<p>You'll need to set your database storage (tables, columns, etc) and collation to use UTF-8 charset.</p>

 	<p>PHP gets a bit more complicated, though. You'll have to use multibyte-safe functions to make sure it works.</p>
