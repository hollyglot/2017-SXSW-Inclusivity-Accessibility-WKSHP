 	<h1>You need UTF-8 charset in your life, specifically in your HTML</h1>

 	<p>To tell your software to accept special characters you're going to want to use the UTF-8 charset in the <head> section of your HTML document (first thing because it tells the browser how to interpret your page) like this:
 	</p>

 	<code>
 		<html>
 		<head>
 		<meta http-equiv=“Content-Type” content=“text/html; charset=utf-8”>
 		</head>
 		<body></body>
 		</html>
 	</code>

 	<h1>Also in your database</h1>

 	<p>You'll need to set your database storage (tables, columns, etc) and collation to use UTF-8 charset.</p>

 	<p>PHP gets a bit more complicated, though. You'll have to use multibyte-safe functions to make sure it works.</p>
